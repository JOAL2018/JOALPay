### JOALPay
JOALPay is a library created in Python that calculates pay of employees for small businesses. Strings of characters and values are randomly created that correspond to usernames and passwords for individual employees using the "add" function. Employees can then log in and out of the system (log in when employee begins working; log out when employee finishes working) and record the number of hours worked by each employee logged in. Once required, the employer can use the "pay" function to calculate the pay of individual employees. The calculated pay takes into account average taxes (national insurance and income tax according to age) and deducts them from each employees' final pay.
